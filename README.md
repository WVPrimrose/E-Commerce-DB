# E-Commerce-DB

This repo will demonstrate the working with routes, models, and creating a schema for an E-Commerce database.

In this assignment, I was asked to create the models, create the relationships within those models by foreign keys and references, and complete the restful API routes in the routes folder.

This video demonstrates the following:

* how to open and close postgress sql
* creating a schema in postgress
* seeding our data
* testing the following routes:
    * category routes: get all, get one, post, update, delete
    * product routes: get all, get one, post, update, delete
    * tag routes: get all, get one, post, update, delete
